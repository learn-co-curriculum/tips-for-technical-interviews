## Some success strategies for during the interview**

**Don’t cram!**

As a candidate you are not expected to know everything about the business and the specialized technical skills required for the role you are interviewing for.  Avoid cramming for knowledge - if hired, you’ll learn these skills over time. 

**Work on your attitude as much as your aptitude**

For a successful interview, personality matters incredibly.  No matter how gifted and skilled you may be, you must be able to communicate effectively and get along and work well with others.  An interviewer wants to see that you have what it takes to build solid relationships. If you come across as unpleasant, too uptight, or as having a “blah” personality, these perceived behaviors are sure to have a negative impact on your candidacy.  Always remember that you are being evaluated for team fit - are you a person the existing staff will like working and socializing with?

**Ask intelligent and thoughtful questions**

Some samples of quality questions to ask include:
- What are the major security challenges the organization is facing? 
- What's the next problem you're trying to solve in the security sphere: compliance, secure coding, or infrastructural issues? 
- Does the organization plan to expand or streamline its security team?
- Questions like these not only display your strong interest in the role for which you're interviewing, but will help you to -- determine whether this position is the right fit for you.

**Be humble! Admit when you don't know something!**

Check your ego at the door!  Realizing how bright you are personally, the security professionals you’re about to meet are a sharp bunch. Be careful on the following points:
- Unless directly asked, we don’t recommend offering advice on how this company you are interviewing with could improve their operations.  If you spend the interview letting them know all the things they’re doing wrong, you’re not likely to get hired. 
- Be ready to answer questions on your current employment situation, and other potentially negative questions.
- “What are your weak points” questions will expose your current gaps on how your skills align with the requirements for this role. Stress that you are eager and want to learn the gaps you currently have.  Never reply that you have none - there’s always something new to learn! 
- Remember that you are not an expert!  When it comes to hard technical skills, show passion - and don’t pretend to know what you don’t.  You can get immediately disqualified by doing so.
- Be ready to relay what blogs and resources you are familiar with, and where your passion is within technology.
- Demonstrate your technical proficiency and creativity in solving technical challenges as they relate to the job description.

**Interviewers already know the right answer before they ask you the question**.

If you simply don’t know the answer to a question, be honest and admit you don’t know. Don’t lie or try to BS your way through it. A graceful way to answer is, “I’m sorry, I don’t know the answer to that, but I’ll take some time to learn about it after this interview.” 

If you simply don’t know the answer to a question, be honest and admit you don’t know. Don’t lie or try to BS your way through it.

## Post interview follow up

Here’s a suggestion for how to never fail a technical interview:  Post interview, immediately research the questions that came up and send a response to their interviewer with the correct answers / any questions that came up while doing research. This must be done ASAP (within 24 hours). Humility (and the ability to admit you didn't know everything) and the ability to research what you don't know are important traits of a Junior cybersecurity professional. 

Sending a Thank You follow up note is CRITICAL.  Your Career Coach can be a great asset here!  Also review the section Interviewing/Sending Thank You's after an interview.
