# Technical Interview Tips

## Admit When You Don't Know Something 

When you’re stumped, try and compare it to something you do know (e.g. “So Tree Maps are like Hash Maps, let me talk about hash maps...”


If you come across an algorithm you don’t know and you are asked to implement it, ask your interviewer to explain it, then do your best to directly transfer what they said into real code. Don’t do any optimizations the first time around.

If you simply don’t know the answer to a question, be honest and admit you don’t know. Don’t lie or try to BS your way through it. 

**Interviewers already know the right answer before they ask you the question**.

A graceful way to answer is, “I’m sorry, I don’t know the answer to that, but I’ll take some time to learn about it after this interview”. 

## What to Do If You Make a Mistake (Stay Calm)

It’s likely you’ll make a few mistakes during the interview. 

- You might have a syntax error when you run your code during the pair-programming portion.
- You might not know the answer to one of the trivia questions.
- You might run out of space while whiteboarding.

There a million other things that might go wrong. Interviewing - technical or otherwise - is stressful. The trick to doing well is staying calm and maintaining your composure.

Every practicing professional in your field knows that you don’t just wake up one day, build an entire application or project from scratch, and run it without a single bug. Real-life project development is iterative, and you’re allowed to make mistakes in an interview. Don’t beat yourself up if you get something wrong.

If you don’t know the answer to one (or some) of the trivia questions, that’s okay. Just admit you don’t know, and the interviewer will move on.

You might have been asked an ambiguous algorithm question and don’t know where to start. The interviewer may have done that intentionally. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and probe for more information. It’s also okay to take a minute and think about the problem before you attempt to solve it.

Last but not least...

## Have Fun With It

It's normal to get anxious when it comes to technical interviews. You may feel like you have a lot riding on the interview, but the best way to succeed is to have as much fun as you can.

Treat technical interviews as if you are already on the team. Ask questions like you would in your group projects. Treat your interviewer like s/he’s your partner and you are collaborating to build a fun new app/project.

If you think of tech interviews as less about being evaluated and more about working with another person, you’ll remove any doubt you had and end up exuding the passion for problem solving that got you into your new profession in the first place.

Knock ‘em dead.
